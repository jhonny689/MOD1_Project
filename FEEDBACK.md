# Part One - Intro to OO
Classes look good! Glad to see you starting to test in the run.rb file as well. If you're pretty confident with the core concepts, start building out a CLI application as well. 

Jhonny - Thank you for the feedback, below is a list of the extras in this version:
    1- I created a CLI and some functionalities
        PS: my CLI would keep listening for user's input until it receives "exit".
    2- I created a console.rb that creates some doctors and some patients to make the CLI nore fun
    
I am thinking of creating a secretary class so a secretary can create a qeue and manage doctors.

# Part 2 

Everything looks good!! I love that you went above and started working on a CLI, thats great practice! all in all I think it looks really good and I dont have any notes! Keep working hard!

# Part 4
- `appointment.rb` is beautiful. `self.exist?` :claps:
- `doctor.rb` and `patient.rb` look good and the beauty that is `Patient#create_appointment` with `Appointment.exist?`. 
- `run.rb` is great and the modularization of the behaviors is beautiful.
